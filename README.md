# SimulatingModalities-BSc
The aim of this project is to design, implement and thoroughly validate generative AI algorithms in wound analysis, being a medical image analysis task. Such generative techniques might be used to e.g., synthesize missing image/data modalities, thus to compensate sensor failures or even missing cameras.
